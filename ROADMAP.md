# Rig Studio Roadmap

A full-fledged 2D rigging/bones/animation tool with basic vector editing —
modeled loosely after Rive, but simple. Checkboxes track status. Start with the
**STATUS DASHBOARD** below for what's outstanding and who needs to weigh in;
completed work lives in **COMPLETED WORK — ARCHIVE** (newest first); **v3 —
Future** at the very bottom is the honest out-of-scope backlog new work should
be drawn from.

## STATUS DASHBOARD

### Austin's review list

*Shipped with flags — eyeball these when back.*

- **Node-editor seam unification design** (61ea081) — REVIEW IT: one merged
  glyph, M side is primary, del-seg opens the pair one-click (UI-only
  unification; the underlying data model is untouched). The design-sweep
  extras (insert-preview ghost, dblclick-insert, hover affordances, drag
  behavior when both seam nodes are selected) remain proposals only, not
  built — see WHAT'S NEXT below.
- **Group-like scale semantics** (63a2b67) — art-with-children's own paths
  scale along with descendants, pivot-anchored. If "own paths + descendants
  both scale" feels wrong in testing, it's a one-predicate-site change —
  flag it.
- **.riv keyed-z + opacity VISUALS** (7155013) — decoder+runtime verified,
  but on-screen stacking/fade blending needs a real player look (rive.rip) —
  pixel readback is impossible headless.
- **Take-pill hash re-pin** (dbac402) — canonical order changed the bytes;
  verified visually via render-frames; the Dosey checkout's riv+rig.json
  outputs were rewritten with the canonical bytes (the generating script has
  since been deleted, 124bca2 — the byte-identity gate now lives in-repo as
  `src/__tests__/goldenRiv.test.ts`, pinned to SHA-256 `a1c6ff4b…`).
- **D1 real-disk round trip** (91ac929) — open a real .rig.json via the OS
  picker, Ctrl+S, confirm the file on disk changed, Save As, check the
  recents dropdown + the installed-PWA flow — only a human can drive the OS
  dialogs.

### Deferred decisions

*Decisions that are Austin's to make — nothing below gets built without his call.*

- **Keyable PATH-level paint channels** (per-path fill/stroke opacity/color
  animation): Rive supports it (our keyed-opacity export already targets
  per-paint SolidColor) and the model could grow path channels — real
  feature scope, his call whether the timeline should ever list paths.
- **Unified skeleton Phase 2 — IK across attachments**: does grabbing a hand
  FABRIK through the spine? Default OFF (IK chain resolution stops at
  attached roots — safer, predictable); the full-body solve is a flag to
  discuss. Documented, not built.
- **Unified skeleton Phase 3 — placement sugar**: starting a pen chain with
  a bone selected but clicking far from its tip could create an attached
  root at the click instead of anchoring at the tip. Needs UX thought; not
  built.
- **D2 (Tauri desktop)**: requires installing the Rust/Tauri toolchain on
  this machine — not doing unattended. D1 (browser-native APIs) proceeds
  instead. Full spec (WebView2 parity, 3–10MB bundles, macOS WKWebView QA)
  is kept in the Desktop archive section below.
- **Lottie**: frozen per earlier ruling (may be deleted); the .riv-only
  export wave proceeds; ALL Lottie questions deferred.
- **Node editor design-sweep extras**: proposals only, not built — need a
  short design write-up and Austin's sign-off before implementing. Full list
  in the Node editor revamp archive section (also indexed in WHAT'S NEXT).
- **H2 MCP tool AUTH/packaging**: built as a local stdio npm package per the
  spec; publishing/naming decisions deferred.

### Standing design principles

**Parts and groups act the same — like Inkscape** (user direction
2026-07-13): parts stay in the MODEL (a part is the unit of animation/export
— the Rive Node; paths stay cheap geometry) but disappear from the MENTAL
MODEL: containers and leaves, uniform Inkscape-like behavior everywhere.
Group vs art-with-children vs plain art must never behave differently for
selection/drill/boxes/ordering; navigation works the same in both modes
(only EDITING ops are Edit-gated); "extract path → own part" is the
promotion path when geometry needs a timeline life. New UX should be checked
against this principle.

**Layer order IS z-order** (shipped 2026-07-13, dbac402): the Layers panel
shows REST structure, and its depth-first display order IS the rest paint
order (`doc.parts` array order = DFS of the hierarchy; sibling order is the
draggable freedom) — moving a subtree in the panel moves its whole paint
block. The keyed stepped `z` channel stays an ANIMATE-TIME-only override
that re-sorts the CANVAS; the panel never re-sorts during animation (panel =
structure you edit, canvas = animated result). Edit mode shows pure rest
order. Full audit history: see COMPLETED WORK ARCHIVE → Layer order IS
z-order.

### What's next

*Every remaining `- [ ]` in this file, indexed here with a pointer to its section.*

- ~~Keyframeable z-order / Opacity channel / Export wave contradiction~~ —
  RESOLVED (orchestrator, 2026-07-13): all three were shipped and verified
  during the run (editor bf05493/e8c1f8a; export 7155013); checkboxes now
  ticked in place with their commit trail. Only the on-screen VISUALS check
  remains, already on the review list above.
- **Unified skeleton Phase 2 — IK across attachments** (Unified skeleton
  archive section) — deferred decision, see STATUS DASHBOARD → Deferred
  decisions above.
- **Unified skeleton Phase 3 — placement sugar** (Unified skeleton archive
  section) — deferred decision, see STATUS DASHBOARD → Deferred decisions
  above.
- **Node editor design sweep** (hover affordances, insert-preview ghost,
  whether Inkscape's double-click-on-path-insert should coexist with
  Alt+click, drag behavior when both seam nodes are selected — Node editor
  revamp archive section) — needs a short proposal for Austin's sign-off
  before implementing.
- **D2. Tauri desktop wrapper** (Desktop / real file access archive section)
  — deferred decision, see STATUS DASHBOARD → Deferred decisions above.
- **H2 hygiene**: `applyClip.ts`/`bindHeadless.ts` are documented
  hand-synced ports of `panels/ai/apply.ts` and `view/rigOpsBind.ts` —
  extract shared pure cores so the ports can't drift (Headless engine + MCP
  server archive section).
- **Latent nodeTypes desync**: the bind bake's `pathToCubics` arc expansion
  is a latent nodeTypes desync on literal-arc paths (Pattern-driven redesign
  pass archive section, view/nodeEditing chokepoint item) — a task chip was
  already spawned for this.

See also **v3 — Future** at the bottom of this file for the longer-range
backlog that isn't scheduled into any wave yet.

## Testing conventions (hard-learned)

- **Dispatch to the true hit target**: interaction tests must target
  `document.elementFromPoint(x, y)` — never a hand-picked element — so overlay
  occlusion bugs (pivot grabs, handles, gizmos) are caught.
- **Simulate full gestures**: a "double-click" is pointerdown/up ×2 then dblclick,
  each re-resolving the hit target (overlays appear between the clicks!). A "drag"
  includes intermediate pointermoves.
- **Never keep DOM references across renders** (test code AND app code): overlay
  rebuilds detach elements; a detached element's CTM is garbage. Re-query, or better,
  compute geometry from the transform strings.
- **Re-read `state.doc` after undo/redo** — snapshots replace the object; captured
  references silently point at the pre-undo clone.
- **Assert on the DOM, not just state** (selection boxes, dimming, handle shapes),
  and on **numeric** outcomes (px drift, cos of angles) rather than "it didn't throw".

## COMPLETED WORK — ARCHIVE

Newest first. Programs/waves below are ordered by their actual git-log
completion timestamps (not by topic), so this really is a changelog you can
trust; the long v1/v2.x version history at the very bottom keeps its original
internal order, formatting-fixed only.

### Post-run live fixes

*User-reported 2026-07-13, on his return — all landed.*

- [x] **First-paint chrome blowup on autosave boots** (da0aa44) — the layers
  splitter's grid column existed in CSS before its DOM did; the canvas got
  measured at 6px and chrome radii baked ~50× (the "black blob"/"red
  circles"). One idempotent buildLayersPanel call before any doc load; new
  bootLayout scenario asserts chrome size at zero-interaction first paint.
- [x] **Drill-down dead in Animate** (6f57e9f) — a stale Setup gate on the
  part→path dblclick branch (+ the path inspector/highlight gates), removed
  per the standing "navigation identical in both modes" ruling; GL5 pins the
  user recipe in BOTH modes, GL6 pins a 3-deep ladder.
- [x] **Origin press bends the outline in node-editing freeze** (725988a) —
  the node-editing overlay branch never rendered freeze joint markers, so
  origin presses fell to the segment-bend pipeline. All three initial
  hypotheses ruled out by live reproduction first; F10 + US6b pin it.
  NOTE: reproduced specifically in NODE-EDITING mode — if the user's own
  repro was in plain pose mode, reopen with exact steps (every non-node-mode
  combination was verified correct).

### AUTONOMOUS RUN

*User directive 2026-07-12: "get through as much of the roadmap as possible
without my input — defer + document decisions."*

Execution order (every arrow-item is now ✓ complete; commit hashes point at
the matching archive entry below): bug wave ✓ (63a2b67) → layers + AI branch
integrations ✓ → arc fix + polish guard ✓ → skinned-drags wave ✓ (617df49) →
shortcuts registry ✓ (a1cee54, parallel worktree) → ergonomics wave ✓
(e623d4a) → **unified-skeleton Phase 1** ✓ (064c521) → **layer-order-is-z
audit** ✓ (dbac402) (both added 2026-07-12 before Austin left) →
context-menu polish ✓ (8203345) → node editor items 1/2/4 ✓ (61ea081; item 3
— the design sweep — is still open, see WHAT'S NEXT) → shared pan/zoom
module ✓ (572566c) → .riv export items ✓ (7155013: keyed-z draw order via
DrawTarget/DrawRules, opacity keys, full hidden-part exclusion — verified
against the @rive-app/canvas harness) → H2 MCP server ✓ (c9c4ee8) → Category
B ✓ (918dd3e/eb79af2) → D1 ✓ (91ac929, File System Access + PWA). Every
wave: full gates + roadmap tick — the whole run plan is COMPLETE as of
2026-07-13.

Austin's review list, the deferred-decisions ledger, and the standing design
principles that came out of this run were promoted to the STATUS DASHBOARD at
the top of this file — everything is preserved there, nothing was dropped.

### Desktop / real file access

*Planned with Austin 2026-07-11 — after the A and H programs.*

- [x] **D1. File System Access API + PWA (browser, no packaging)** (91ac929) — behind a
  small storage interface (open/save/saveAs/recents): Chromium's
  showSaveFilePicker gives writable in-place Save (no more download-per-save);
  persisted IndexedDB file handles make RECENT FILES real (subsumes the
  Category-B item — don't build it twice); PWA manifest for installability.
  Interaction coverage round-trips through OPFS handles (the OS picker is
  undrivable by automation) — the REAL-DISK round trip is on the review list.
  Feature-detected; Firefox/Safari keep the download flow. Small (~day) —
  benefits the deployed Pages app immediately; may slot earlier if desired.
- [ ] **D2. Tauri desktop wrapper (NOT Electron — performance)** — native
  installable reusing D1's storage interface with a Tauri fs/dialog
  implementation: system WebView (WebView2=Chromium on Windows, so canvas
  behavior matches the dev browser), 3–10MB bundles vs Electron's 100MB+
  Chromium+Node, low memory, auto-updater, Win/macOS/Linux. macOS WKWebView
  needs a QA pass (Safari-engine quirks). Electron only if a Node-side need
  ever appears (none foreseen).

### Category B — table-stakes polish

*User-requested; queued after the A and H programs per user decision. Done
2026-07-13 (918dd3e + eb79af2), except recent files, which landed with D1.*

- [x] **Find/search parts** in the Layers tree (panels/layersSearch.ts —
  flattened non-matches, ancestors kept, fold state untouched).
- [x] **Project frame rate + frames/timecode display** — doc.fps seeded 60 by
  normalizeDoc, threaded through BOTH exporters (fps=60 byte-identity pinned;
  fps=30 decoder-pinned); timeline readout click-toggles ms↔frames (persisted).
- [x] **Quick-save vs Save As** — filename remembered per doc name; Ctrl+Shift+S
  Save As; found+fixed: save/selectAll bindings never checked shift. Browser
  filename-memory only; real overwrite lands with D1 file handles.
- [x] **Recent files** menu — landed WITH D1 (91ac929): localStorage ring +
  IndexedDB handle persistence, Open… dropdown.
- [x] **Invert selection (Ctrl+I) / Select None (Ctrl+Shift+A)** via the registry.
- [x] **Empty-state call-to-action** — CTAs proxy-click the real toolbar buttons
  so every existing guard applies.

(Already tracked — see v3 / v2.13: File→New, rulers/guides, zoom % + zoom-to-selection
+ 100% reset, copy/paste parts [note: Ctrl+C/V are keyframe-only, no-op in Edit mode],
marquee part-select, layers visibility/lock/opacity, playback range/work area,
key-pose + auto-key, SVG-import error surfacing.)

### Headless engine + MCP server

*Planned 2026-07-11. H1 complete; H2 complete 2026-07-13 (c9c4ee8) — see the
checklist below.*

Goal: agents (Claude Code, Codex, any MCP client) create and edit rigs/animations
in chat without the website, producing .rig.json the editor opens (and .riv
directly). Feasible because core/, geometry/, io/ are already DOM-free (the unit
suite runs in Node); the user's `scripts/exportPipTakePill.ts` pipeline was the
original proof-of-concept seed (deleted 2026-07-13, 124bca2, once H1's CLI and
H2's MCP tools matured into the real production path — the byte-identity gate
that pipeline used to provide now lives in-repo as
`src/__tests__/goldenRiv.test.ts`, pinned to SHA-256 `a1c6ff4b…`, run inside
`npm test` on any machine).

- [x] **H1. `rig-studio-core` headless package + CLI** — COMPLETE. Wave H1a (b2b0cb3):
  `src/headless/index.ts` package entry (pure facade over the DOM-free
  core/geometry/io surface + `importSvgHeadless` via scoped jsdom DOMParser,
  importer untouched); CLI (`rig-studio` bin / `npx tsx src/headless/cli.ts`):
  `rig import` (nested part tree summary + .rig.json), `rig validate`
  (normalization drift + round-trip byte-stability, exit 0/1), `rig export-riv`.
  Module-graph test enforces headless never reaches view/panels/timeline/ui.
  Wave H1b (4a3322f): `rig render-frames --clip X` — the pose math extracted
  VERBATIM to `geometry/pose.ts` (view/pose.ts is a thin delegator injecting
  ctx.poseSampler; one shared kernel, no editor/headless drift, pinned by
  poseSharedKernel.test.ts), `headless/composePose.ts` (posed standalone SVG:
  z-sorted draw order, sampled opacity, hidden excluded, artboard frame;
  skinned parts RIGID like both exporters, stated in CLI output),
  `headless/renderFrames.ts` (@resvg/resvg-js PNGs, A3-cluster default times
  via the extracted `core/filmstripTimes.ts`). E2E-proven by real subprocess +
  PNG centroid tracking that returns byte-identical at the loop point.
  Known caveats carried forward: geometric auto-bind uses DOM isPointInFill
  (headless binding = pure point-in-fill or explicit part targets), and much of
  core/channels + applyRigChanges read/write the `state` singleton — headless
  scripts set `state.doc = doc` first (H2's in-memory sessions will want a
  save/restore or pure-doc variant).
- [x] **H2. `rig-studio-mcp` server** (c9c4ee8 — 12 tools over stdio, in-memory
  sessions with whole-AppState scoped swap, one clip schema shared with the
  in-app assistant, e2e-proven via a real SDK client; packaging/naming
  deferred per the ledger. HYGIENE QUEUED: applyClip.ts/bindHeadless.ts are
  documented hand-synced ports of panels/ai/apply.ts and view/rigOpsBind.ts —
  extract shared pure cores so the ports can't drift) — LOCAL stdio transport (an npm package the
  AI client spawns on demand — no hosting, no ports; remote/HTTP hosting is an
  optional later tier). Strictly a wrapper over H1: needed for shell-less clients
  (Claude Desktop etc.) + schema-guided tool calls + in-memory doc sessions;
  Claude Code can already drive the H1 CLI directly. Tools: import_svg,
  list_parts/analyze_rig
  (A5's RigProfile), add_bones/bind, apply_clip (the SAME structured schema as
  the in-app assistant — one schema, two front doors), add_state_machine,
  render_filmstrip, export_riv, save/load. Output files open directly in the
  editor for review/refinement. One brain (the AI-animate system), two mouths
  (in-app panel, MCP).

### Pattern-driven redesign pass

*User-approved 2026-07-12 — runs after H1b lands.*

Origin: the user rejected "documented exception" status for the two remaining
monoliths and mandated named design patterns over proximity/convention (now a
CLAUDE.md convention: "Think in named patterns, not conventions").

- [x] **view/interactions/ — gesture-pipeline redesign** (5ef6ae5) — done exactly
  per the approved design: 11-row static `GESTURE_PIPELINES` table (final order:
  boneChain, gizmo, boneTip, pan, non-primary-button guard, handles, node,
  pivot, nodesBendMarquee, artwork, blank — each row commented with why it
  precedes the next), shared `HitContext`, uniform `lifecycle.ts`, nine
  feature-complete pipeline modules (max 219 code lines). Converted one row at
  a time against a shrinking legacy scaffold, interaction suite green after
  every step. Priority pinned by `gesturePriority.test.ts` (mutation-checked:
  swapping pivot/artwork fails 9 scenarios across 4 files). Documented
  deviations: skinnedArt/boneGlyph are sub-cases inside artwork's claim (they
  share its once-only selection side effect); node vs nodesBendMarquee split
  because pivot sits between them in the real cascade order.
- [x] **view/nodeEditing chokepoint + split** (68f24fc): `applyStructuralEdit`
  in `nodeEditing/structural.ts` is the one door (d/nodeTypes write + override
  drop + cache invalidate + DOM sync + selection clear), enforced by
  `nodeEditingChokepoint.test.ts`; family split dragMath/structural/typeOps
  behind a facade. BONUS: found+fixed a real latent bug (the bend pipeline's
  implicit-Z split never dropped overrides) and pinned the previously-unpinned
  invariant with scenario B31 (mutation-verified). Flagged for later: the
  bind bake's pathToCubics arc expansion is a latent nodeTypes desync on
  literal-arc paths (task chip spawned).
- [x] **Pattern audit over the six pinned files** (done 2026-07-12, read-only).
  Verdicts, ranked by payoff:
  1. **main.ts — DONE** (a1cee54): registry + cascades in ui/shortcuts*.ts,
     help rows generated, B key added, main.ts 522→243 and off the list.
     Original spec follows: keydown handler (~60% of the file) → a binding
     Registry + two explicit Chain-of-Responsibility arrays (DELETE_HANDLERS /
     ESCAPE_HANDLERS) in a new `ui/shortcuts.ts`; help.ts's keyboard rows
     GENERATED from the registry (killing the sync convention, which the audit
     proved broken twice — both drifts fixed in 4ed4127); main.ts exits the
     grandfather list. Risk note: only 2 of ~30 bindings are tested through
     the real dispatcher — the wave needs a full manual binding pass.
     ALSO IN THIS WAVE (user request 2026-07-12): (a) verify EVERY help-overlay
     row is a real, correct binding while building the registry; (b) rows that
     document mouse/tool gestures rather than keys (e.g. "Bone tool
     (canvas-tools ⌂)") move to a clearly separated gestures section, never
     mixed in as pseudo-shortcuts; (c) give the bone tool a REAL key — `B`
     arms bone-chain placement (guarded like the other tool keys V/T/R/I,
     no ctrl/meta/alt), registered + documented via the registry itself.
  2. **ai/claude.ts — DONE** (b36b048, folded into the bones-awareness wave):
     ai/prompts.ts extracted; claude.ts 489→289, off the grandfather list.
  3. **timeline/graph.ts — DONE** (572566c): geometry/viewRect.ts shared
     kernel with old-formula oracle tests; graph.ts ceiling ratcheted down
     to 387; view/camera.ts exclusion documented in the module header.
  4. **io/exportLottie.ts — cohesive as-is, ZERO test coverage**: test wave
     CANCELLED by user (2026-07-12) — Lottie's usefulness in this project is
     in question and the exporter MAY BE DELETED later; leave the code as-is
     and do not invest in Lottie coverage or features without asking first.
  5. **geometry/paths.ts — cohesive as-is**: one representation throughout;
     its cross-file invariant already sits behind nodeEditing's chokepoint.
  6. **panels/layers.ts — cohesive as-is**: one tree widget; drag pipelines
     are coupled to the DOM they decorate; no reuse case.
  Items 1–3 fold into this redesign pass after the gesture-pipeline wave,
  in rank order.
- [x] **Size-ratchet test** (`architecture.test.ts`) landed 2026-07-11 —
  CODE-line counts (comments/blanks free per user ruling), grandfathered
  ceilings shrink-only, new files fail >300, stale-entry honesty check.

### Node editor revamp

*User-requested 2026-07-12 — "needs a pretty decent polish pass"; design pass
first, then implement; reproduce-first on the bugs.*

- [x] **Alt+click ON a segment inserts a node THERE** (61ea081; the old
  node-relative midpoint insert retired outright) — today insert requires
  selecting a node and Alt+clicking, splitting an adjacent segment at its
  midpoint ("a random segment adjacent"). Reuse the bend pipeline's geometric
  `segmentHit` (segment index + parameter t under the cursor) so Alt+click on
  any segment splits at exactly the clicked point (de Casteljau at t). Keep
  the old gesture working during transition or retire it deliberately.
- [x] **Symmetric/smooth nodes always get BOTH handles** (61ea081) — the type ops only
  mirror EXISTING handles; a node whose neighbor segment is a line (L) ends up
  "symmetric" with one arm. The op must synthesize the missing handle by
  converting the adjacent L→C (the bend's "handles grow" conversion, applied
  at type-set time). Symmetric = equal lengths both sides, always.
- [x] **Closing-seam stacked nodes** (61ea081 — SHIPPED WITH A REVIEW FLAG for
  Austin: UI-only unification, primary glyph = the M side, pair splits only
  via del-seg which now works one-click on the merged glyph; data model
  untouched) (the user's "new node underneath") —
  bending the implicit closing segment splices an explicit closing cubic whose
  endpoint coincides with the path's FIRST node (by design: shape stays
  closed, zero-length Z). The DATA is coherent; the UI presents two stacked,
  independently-draggable nodes. Fix at the editor level: render/hit-test the
  seam as ONE node (drag moves both coincident points; the pair splits only
  via an explicit "open path" op). Needs design care around nodeTypes and
  overrides indexing — route through the chokepoint.
- [x] **Type-button state highlight** (61ea081; also found+fixed applyNodeOp
  never notifying — stale inspector) — selecting node(s) subtly highlights the
  matching smooth/symmetric/corner button in the inspector node-ops section
  (mixed selection = no highlight or an indeterminate state), independent of
  the node glyph shapes. (Glyphs already encode type: diamond/square/circle.)
- [ ] **Design sweep for the rest of the polish pass** — hover affordances on
  segments/nodes, insert-preview ghost under Alt-hover, whether Inkscape's
  double-click-on-path-inserts should exist alongside Alt+click, drag behavior
  when both seam nodes are selected. Produce a short proposal for user
  sign-off before implementing.

### Context-menu polish

*User-requested 2026-07-12.*

- [x] **Suppress the native browser context menu app-wide** (8203345) — a document-level
  `contextmenu` preventDefault: where no in-app menu applies, NO menu appears
  (never the browser's). EXCEPTION: text-entry elements (inputs/textareas —
  the API-key field, rename editors, prompt box) keep the native menu, since
  suppressing it there kills right-click copy/paste.
- [x] **Right-click menus on PATHS, not just parts** (8203345 — incl. the
  extract-path op, absorbing the standalone roadmap item; skinned-part path
  deletion refused per the chokepoint rule) — path rows in the Layers
  panel and paths on canvas (entered-part/node-editing contexts) get an in-app
  context menu: rename (once the layers wave lands), delete path, raise/lower
  within the part, move to part… (the new cross-part move as a menu action),
  and "extract path → own part" (absorbs the existing standalone roadmap item
  as a menu entry).

### Layer order IS z-order

*User idea 2026-07-12 — fleshed out; the design is sound, not crazy; folded
into the autonomous run after the skeleton work.*

The design rule itself ("panel order = paint order") is now a STANDING DESIGN
PRINCIPLE — see STATUS DASHBOARD → Standing design principles for the current
wording. The audit that enforced it:

- [x] **Audit + enforce "panel order = paint order"** (dbac402 — seven real
  divergences found+fixed at the setParent/structural-op chokepoints; the
  then-current byte-identity fixture was re-pinned (hash 3754fc45) after
  visual verification via headless render-frames — that take-pill pipeline
  was later deleted (124bca2) in favor of the in-repo golden gate,
  `src/__tests__/goldenRiv.test.ts`, pinned to SHA-256 `a1c6ff4b…`; NOTE for
  Austin: the Dosey checkout's riv+rig.json outputs were rewritten with the
  canonical bytes, though the generating script has since been deleted):
  doc.parts array order and tree display order can diverge across subtree
  boundaries today; canonicalize (paint order = DFS of the hierarchy;
  sibling order = the draggable freedom), verify the importer already
  satisfies it (it walks the SVG depth-first), normalizeDoc repairs legacy
  docs, PageUp/Down + the stacking row + panel drag-reorder all preserve it.
  Exporters inherit (they read doc.parts order). Interaction tests: reorder
  right_arm above body in the panel → canvas + both exporters stack it
  above; keyed z still re-sorts the canvas in Animate while the panel holds
  still.

### Unified skeleton: cross-chain bone attachment

*User-requested 2026-07-12, in the autonomous run — "the entire pip could be
rigged so his body (spine) can affect the arm bones… moving relative to one
another by hierarchy."*

Why it's disjointed today: each limb chain parents under its own art
(hierarchy-as-assignment) and the spine chain under the pip group — FOUR
disconnected skeletons. Bone motion propagates through bone parent links only.
The LBS math already follows bone WORLD transforms, so connecting the chains
(arm root bone becomes a child of the spine bone) makes everything compose —
the feature is making that attachment first-class and safe.

- [x] **Phase 1 — attach via Layers drag** (064c521; follow-up: freeze
  origin-drag on an attached root, in flight): dragging a chain's
  ROOT bone onto a bone of ANOTHER chain parents it WORLD-PRESERVING (fold the
  chain-frame delta into the root's rest, the foldLostArtPoseIntoBoneRest
  precedent — zero visual jump, bind data untouched). The new link is an
  **ATTACHED ROOT** (`RigPart.attachedRoot: true`, set by cross-chain reparent):
  origin ≠ parent tip is LEGAL for it (a shoulder isn't at the spine's tip) —
  the connected-chain no-gap invariant is scoped to chain-INTERNAL links only
  (tests updated accordingly). `boneChain` (the auto-bind unit) STOPS at
  attached roots — extending an arm chain must never re-target the body's art —
  while POSE composition uses the full hierarchy (it already does: parentId).
  Overlay: draw a subtle dashed attachment link parent-bone→attached-root so
  the coupling is visible (GOTCHA: visible counterpart). Un-attach = drag the
  root elsewhere (same world-preserving fold). Acceptance = the user's Pip:
  spine bone rotates → both arm chains AND their deformed arms ride; arm IK
  still works locally; undo restores exactly.

### Editing ergonomics wave

*User-requested 2026-07-12 — runs right after the layers-branch integration;
items 2–3 build on the integrated layers.ts.*

- [x] **Keyframe selection drives part selection** (e623d4a) — clicking a keyframe in the
  Animate timeline selects the track's TARGET part (layers highlights it +
  auto-expands ancestors, inspector shows it — "extremely hard to see what I'm
  editing" with unnamed bones otherwise). Multi-key/marquee selection selects
  the union of target parts (multi-selection exists). Tracks targeting the
  synthetic `root` skip part selection. Key retime drags don't re-fire
  selection churn beyond the initial click.
- [x] **Layers hover tooltips** (e623d4a) — part and path rows carry `title` = the full
  label, so truncated names reveal on hover.
- [x] **Layers panel horizontally resizable** (e623d4a, panels/layersResize.ts) — a draggable splitter on the
  layers/canvas boundary with persisted width (localStorage, like the
  timeline's height splitter in timeline/tlState.ts — same pattern, same
  persistence discipline: editor pref, never doc state), min/max clamped.

### Skinned-part posing decision

*User ruling 2026-07-12: "Allow rotate+translate."*

Code truth behind the ruling: a skinned part's keyed rotate/tx/ty WORKS — its
bones are parented under it, bone world placement composes through the chain
(which samples the part's keyed channels), and LBS recomputes from the bones —
and .riv exports the same rigid transform, so editor and runtime agree. Part
SCALE does not carry (editor scale never propagates to children) while Rive
Node scale would — scale stays blocked on skinned parts.

- [x] **Editor: re-enable rotate + translate pose drags on skinned parts** (617df49)
  (Animate keys / Edit rest) — remove the skinned gate in the artwork pipeline
  for those two manipulations only; IK stays the articulation gesture; scale
  handles stay off with the skin hint explaining why; inspector keyed sx/sy
  fields on a skinned part lock with the same hint (WYSIWYG: don't offer a
  channel the canvas won't show). Interaction scenarios + the hint counterpart.
  RUNS AFTER the live-bug wave (same pipeline files).
- [x] **AI bones-awareness** (b36b048, incl. the ai/prompts.ts extraction —
  claude.ts 489→289, grandfather entry gone — and the polish.ts
  squash-guard for bone-deformed targets): buildScenePayload marks
  skinned parts (skinned: true + their bone chain ids/labels); TARGETING_RULES
  teaches the model: articulate a skinned limb via its BONE rotate channels
  (root-first, follow-through); part-level rotate/tx/ty = whole-limb accent
  ON TOP (legitimate but never a substitute for joint articulation — the
  gesture-file failure mode: left_arm rotated as one slab, right_arm got bones
  AND a redundant −55° part rotation stacked); NEVER sx/sy on skinned parts.
  Combined with the queued ai/prompts.ts extraction (audit rank 2) so frozen
  claude.ts sheds its ceiling first.

### Live bug queue

*User-reported 2026-07-12, next main-tree wave after nodeEditing.*

- [x] **Group-like selection for art-with-children** (63a2b67) — every group behavior
  (click-selects-ancestor, dblclick drill-down, entered-group tracking, union
  selection box, group handle sets w/ descendant scale distribution) keys on
  `kind === 'group'`; an ART part carrying child parts (face→eyes, the
  recursive importer's normal shape) gets none of them. Fix: one `groupLike`
  predicate (group OR art-with-child-parts; bones excluded) applied at all
  sites (artwork pipeline, dblclick, focus, overlayHandles, handles pipeline).
  User's acceptance: click eyes on canvas → selects face w/ union box; dblclick
  eye → drills into face, selects eyes; Layers face click → union box.
- [x] **Ctrl+G leaves the canvas dimmed** (63a2b67 — repairEnteredGroups prunes
  inside every focusContext call; reproduced at 8-9 dimmed parts pre-fix) (user: "pip semi-transparent until
  refresh") — suspected stale `ctx.enteredGroups` app-state after structural
  edits: grouping while drilled in (or restructuring around an entered id)
  leaves focusContext dimming everything outside a stale subtree; refresh
  resets app-state, doc was never wrong. Fix: structural ops (group/ungroup/
  delete/reparent) must repair or clear entered-group state; reproduce first.

### Architecture refactor pass

*User-mandated — run after the A program + fixes, alongside/before H;
meanwhile the size-ratchet test stops NEW violations.*

The feature blitz outgrew the ~200-line standard in 8 files (audit 2026-07-11):
model.ts 1634, smPanel.ts 1404, exportRiv.ts 1116, inspector.ts 981, ai.ts 938,
timeline.ts 817, overlay.ts 801, rigOps.ts 769 (interactions/nodeEditing are the
two documented exceptions). Target shapes, each behind a facade per the view/
precedent, zero behavior change, gated on the full suites:

*(Every "take-pill .riv byte-identical" check below was run against the
since-deleted `scripts/exportPipTakePill.ts` pipeline — it was removed
2026-07-13 (124bca2) and its role is now filled by the in-repo golden gate,
`src/__tests__/goldenRiv.test.ts`, pinned to SHA-256 `a1c6ff4b…`. The
verification RESULTS recorded below still stand as history.)*

- [x] **io/riv/** (c180e36) — exportRiv.ts → writer/keys/scene/animation/
  stateMachine behind an index.ts facade (all < 300 code lines); test decoder
  promoted to `__tests__/rivDecoder.ts`. Verified BYTE-IDENTICAL output
  (take-pill .riv SHA-256 unchanged before/after).
- [x] **core/ split** (c6185ef) — model.ts → 9 modules (docTypes/smTypes/appState/
  channels/boneOps/partHierarchy/structuralOps/serialization/idGen) behind the
  permanent `model.ts` facade — zero consumer edits, export surface verified
  identical (68 names), take-pill .riv byte-identical.
- [x] **panels/sm/** (fef677c) — smPanel.ts → 9 modules (state/graphCamera/
  graphInteract/graph/preview/props/header/globals/panel) behind a 2-line
  facade; export surface identical (5 names); built in a parallel worktree,
  clean cherry-pick.
- [x] **panels/ai/** (f902260, done as part of A4) — ai.ts → panel/apply/preview/
  previewBar/fields/requests/state/threadStrip/threads behind an index.ts facade.
- [x] **inspector sections** (f5690b0) → 9 modules in `panels/inspectorSections/`
  (shared/transform/bone/stacking/skin/align/nodeOps/object/panel) behind a
  1-line facade; built in a parallel worktree, rebased with main's 146-line
  z/opacity/scale/A0 delta ported hunk-by-hunk.
- [x] **timeline/ internals** (f4bc4b0) → tlState/transport/lanes/keyProps/panel
  behind a 7-line facade (graph.ts untouched); parallel worktree, rebased with
  the stepped-z easing hunk ported.
- [x] **view/overlay.ts + view/rigOps.ts** (d6343dc) — overlay → orchestration
  (290 lines) + overlayHandles/overlayBones/overlayNodes; rigOps → 17-line
  re-export over rigOpsPlacement/rigOpsBind/rigOpsEdit/rigOpsNodeBinding.
  Both grandfather entries removed; take-pill .riv byte-identical.

**Refactor pass COMPLETE (2026-07-12):** every planned split landed — io/riv/,
core/ (9 modules), panels/ai/ (A4), panels/sm/, inspectorSections/, timeline
internals, overlay + rigOps clusters. Grandfather list is down to
view/interactions.ts + view/nodeEditing.ts (redesign QUEUED below — the old
"documented exception" status was retired by user decision 2026-07-12) plus six
small pinned files (ai/claude 489, main 522, paths 434, graph 395, layers 347,
exportLottie 327), audit queued below.

### Post-A bone feel fixes

*User-reported — build after the A program, before H.*

- [x] **Freeze origin-drag rotates unselected bones** (10c0ee9) — freeze mode now
  renders a joint marker for EVERY bone (visible counterpart, screen-constant,
  zoom-sweep-tested), each carrying `data-part-id`; the press resolves ITS bone,
  selects it, and starts the joint drag in the same gesture. Rotation stays on
  body/gizmo-ring drags; outside freeze behavior is byte-unchanged (regression
  pin F7c). Scenarios F7–F9.
- [x] **Grab-point-relative IK (no tip snap)** (10c0ee9) — `view/ikDrag.ts`
  (extracted pipeline; interactions.ts 958→915) maps the actual press position
  into the grabbed bone's frame: a tip grab is tip-as-effector, a mid-body grab
  drives THAT point (tip trails rigidly — first-move continuity asserted), a
  tip-handle press with the IK tool now solves the whole chain, and skinned-art
  grabs anchor at the grabbed surface point too. Same FABRIK; `chainStepDelta`
  in geometry/ik.ts handles the off-axis write-back. Scenarios IK1–IK4; B24
  tightened 8px→3px.

### AI Animate System v2

*Program planned 2026-07-11 with Austin — build in order.*

One coherent system, not bolted-on features: every phase feeds the next. Decisions
locked: root is DEMOTED (groups are the figure controls — the shadow-follows-pip
bug class dies here); create-vs-modify are two explicit buttons; refinement threads
are CLIP-scoped; templates are rig-agnostic via a learned Rig Profile; the
principles pass integrates last as a preset refinement turn.

- [x] **A0. Targeting & root demotion** (3226dbf) — the AI keys `root.tx/ty` and drags the
  shadow along. Fix: (1) request context gains the SELECTION (id/label of the
  selected part/group) + the part tree with group structure; (2) prompt rules:
  NEVER key `root`; whole-figure motion targets the user's selected group or the
  group covering the moving parts (props/shadows deliberately outside stay
  untouched); (3) UI: the Figure(root) inspector section is removed from Animate
  (legacy `root` tracks keep sampling/exporting for back-compat; docs note the
  deprecation). Also in this wave: the CLEAN-PREVIEW toggle — one Animate-mode
  button hiding ALL editor chrome (bones, pivots, joints, dashed lines, selection
  boxes, gizmos) to watch the animation clean.
- [x] **A1. Session & intent UX** (e4f3ac6) — prompt text persists across view/mode switches
  until sent (module state, like the busy flag). TWO actions replace the single
  button: [Create new animation] → AI returns a clip + a NAME, added to the clips
  dropdown and selected; [Modify current] → edits the active clip, with a
  "protect playhead keys" checkbox (keys at the current playhead time are locked:
  prompt instructs it AND post-apply enforcement restores any protected key the
  model touched). Duration is pinned: the schema echoes the clip's set duration
  and validation rejects/clamps drift.
- [x] **A2. Preview-before-apply** (b547c4b/4797149) (idea 4) — AI results NEVER mutate the doc
  directly: the returned clip renders as a looping preview (pose-sampler
  playback, the SM-preview infrastructure) with an Apply / Retry / Discard bar.
  Apply = the existing atomic one-undo path; Retry = posts back into the thread
  (A4) with the preview visible; Discard = zero trace. Structural changes (new
  bones) preview as ghost overlays where feasible, else summarized in the bar.
- [x] **A3. Filmstrip vision** (9a49106) (idea 1) — replace the single playhead snapshot
  with a strip of rendered frames (t = 0/25/50/75/100% of the clip, or one per
  keyframe cluster when denser), downscaled, payload-capped. Sent on BOTH
  animate and critique calls so Claude sees motion arcs, clipping, dead holds —
  and on A2 Retry turns it re-renders the CANDIDATE clip so refinement reacts to
  what the model actually produced.
- [x] **A4. Clip-scoped refinement threads** (f902260, incl. the panels/ai
  folder split — first ratchet burn-down) (idea 2) — each clip keeps a
  conversation thread (app-state + localStorage keyed by doc name + clip name;
  last N turns): prior clip JSON, user instructions, model changes-summaries.
  The prompt box becomes the thread composer; A2's Retry is a thread turn;
  switching clips switches threads. Clearing/deleting a clip drops its thread.
- [x] **A5. Rig Profile + motion templates** (2faf597) (idea 5, rig-AGNOSTIC) —
  `ai/rigProfile.ts` builds a cached RigProfile from pure heuristics (bone
  chains with deformed art, left/right symmetry pairs incl. matrix-mirror
  detection, role guesses torso/head/limb/face/shadow/prop, figure group),
  memoized on a hierarchy signature. Five template quick-actions (walk cycle,
  idle breathing, jump, wave, emphatic gesture) are motion ARCHETYPES that
  FILL the prompt box (never auto-send) with profile-resolved targets and a
  beat map in absolute ms from the set duration; sending routes through the
  normal Create flow so A2 preview / A3 filmstrip / A4 threads apply for
  free. Every Create/Modify request leads with a compact RIG PROFILE block
  (`ai/profileBlock.ts` leaf — claude.ts stays at its ratchet ceiling).
  Rig-agnosticism is test-enforced: a source grep bans sample part names and
  the girl fixture drives the same buttons naming HER structure.
- [x] **A6. Principles polish pass** (593e3d8) (idea 3, LAST — integrates with
  everything) — the one-click "Polish" button (`panels/ai/polish.ts`, mounted
  beside Modify; disabled with an explanatory title when the clip has no keys):
  `buildPolishInstruction` analyzes the clip's own tracks (biggest per-track
  moves → anticipation candidates when there's ≥80ms lead-in, the same
  arrivals → settle-with-overshoot, a scale-relative fast-vertical test →
  optional subtle squash-and-stretch, a loop-clean check → "keep first/last
  matching") plus the A5 profile (follow-through cascades named per bone
  chain), opens with an explicit choreography-preservation contract, and
  sends IMMEDIATELY through the normal Modify flow via `runAnimate`'s
  `instructionOverride` — safe because A2's preview still gates the apply,
  and protect-playhead / duration pinning / RIG PROFILE block / A3
  filmstrips / A4 thread recording all apply for free. The user's own prompt
  draft is never touched (`ai.polishInstruction` carries the turn). Bonus fix
  found live: Polish now disables the instant ANY request starts (it lives
  outside `AiFields`, so `setBusy` had missed it) — regression-tested.

**A program COMPLETE (2026-07-12):** A0–A6 all landed and verified; final
gates 492 unit / 19 files, 159 interaction / 24 files, build clean.

(The former "swap default sample to girl_example" FINAL item was CANCELLED
2026-07-11 — user decision: Pip stays as the permanent public demo sample.
girl_example.svg remains a nested-import test fixture only.)

- [x] **Extract path → own part** (8203345, in the context-menu wave — pure
  reuse of addNullPart + movePathToPart) — a context-menu op wrapping a path in its own
  part with frame compensation (geometry stays put), so imported single-path
  details (e.g. a body's shadow path) become independently animatable/reorderable
  across parts. (Follow-on to the path-row select/reorder fix; cross-part path
  drags stay rejected until this exists.)

### Group-level auto-bind

*User-blocked — immediate, parallel with A0.*

- [x] **Chains on a group bind ALL its art descendants** (7742f8c) — completing the locked
  strict-hierarchy design ("multi-object cases group first"): when a chain's
  parent/selection is a group (or any part with child art), auto-bind expands to
  every art descendant — each part gets its own weights from its own geometry
  against the same chain (binding is already multi-part capable; only TARGETING
  stops at one part today). Render-neutral per part; per-node overrides stay
  per-part; undo = one step with the chain.

### Pre-A0 bones fixes

*User-reported; build before the AI program.*

- [x] **Pen-tool bone chains** (cd277af) — click sets the origin, move shows a live preview
  bone, click sets the tip AND starts the next bone at that joint; repeat to grow
  the chain; Escape/Enter/double-click ends chain mode. One checkpoint for the
  whole chain (single undo removes it); auto-bind fires ONCE at chain completion.
  Replaces press-drag-release + per-bone rearming.
- [x] **Bones hoisted to root on bind (regression)** (cd277af — root cause: bindPartsToBones zeroed the ART part's parentId since P4; latent until nested import) — bones are again leaving
  their parent object when assigned. a374dbd's in-place world-preserving fold was
  supposed to keep parentId; reproduce the user's flow (suspect: art nested in a
  GROUP, or a bind entry point that never got the fold — node bind / AI bindParts
  / frozen rebind), fix, and pin parentId stability through EVERY bind path.

### v1 — Vector editing basics

- [x] **Flip horizontal / vertical** for the selected part(s) — in place (around each
  part's own rendered bbox center), implemented as negative rest scale so it exports
  cleanly and never moves the joint. Shortcuts `H` / `V` in Setup mode + toolbar
  buttons.
- [x] **Align & distribute** (Setup mode, multi-selection) — align left / center /
  right / top / middle / bottom, distribute with equal gaps horizontally/vertically.
  Reference object options: selection bbox · first selected · last selected · canvas.
  Pure math in `src/align.ts` (unit-tested), applied through parent-chain-aware rest
  translation.
- [x] **Bezier node handles, properly** — visible handle lines connecting nodes to
  their control points; click to select a node; smooth-handle mirroring while
  dragging (opposite handle stays collinear when it was collinear, Alt breaks);
  one-shot **corner / smooth / symmetric** operations on the selected node; line ↔
  curve segment conversion.

### v1 — Rigging

- [x] **Bones** — first-class null parts (`kind: 'bone'`): no artwork, just a joint
  that renders as a canvas glyph, selectable/draggable like any part. Chains of bones
  = multiple joints per limb (shoulder → elbow → wrist), with artwork parts parented
  to any bone. Placed by click ("+ bone" then click canvas; parented to the current
  selection).
- [x] **Groups / ungrouping** — Ctrl+G wraps the selected parts in a group null
  (`kind: 'group'`) pivoted at the selection center; Ctrl+Shift+G dissolves it,
  children re-adopt its parent and absorb its rest translate/rotate exactly. Groups
  pose/animate as one (they're just parts with children).
- [x] **Group-aware selection** — clicking artwork inside a group selects the group;
  double-click steps inside (group → part → path, Escape steps back out). Layers
  panel: Ctrl+click toggles rows in/out of the multi-selection; bones and groups get
  distinct icons.
- [x] **Exports understand bones/groups** — Compose skips draw calls for partless
  nulls but keeps them in transform chains; Lottie emits them as native null layers.

### v1 — AI assistant

- [x] **Structural edits (opt-in)** — an "allow rig changes" toggle lets Claude
  return, alongside the clip: new bones (label/pivot/parent), reparenting, and pivot
  moves. Applied atomically with the clip in one undo step, with cycle guards.
- [x] **Richer rig context** — the scene JSON sent to Claude marks part kinds
  (art/bone/group), includes the full hierarchy and rest pose, so choreography can
  target bone chains sensibly.

### v1 — Quality gates (define "complete")

- [x] Type-check + `npm run build` clean.
- [x] Unit tests for all new pure logic (align/distribute, flip math, group/ungroup
  absorption, bone creation, structural-change application).
- [x] Live browser verification of every v1 feature via the preview harness.
- [x] CLAUDE.md + this file updated; conventions section covers new invariants.

### v2 — first batch (done)

- [x] **Context-aware movement** — a part selected in Layers (or via double-click
  entry) is manipulated directly on canvas even inside a group; Layers selection
  opens the part's ancestor groups. Clicking unselected grouped artwork still selects
  the group.
- [x] **Transform tools with axis gizmos** (Rive/Blender-style) — V select,
  T translate (red X / green Y arrows constrain to an axis, center square free-moves),
  R rotate (ring around the live pivot), I inverse kinematics. Tools work in both
  modes (Setup edits rest, Animate keys). Flips rebound to Shift+H / Shift+V.
- [x] **Inverse kinematics** — analytic two-bone solver (`src/ik.ts`, unit-tested for
  exact reach, out-of-range clamping, bend-direction preservation): drag a limb end
  with the IK tool and its two nearest ancestor joints solve to follow; one ancestor
  falls back to aiming.
- [x] **Bone polish** — bones are drawn by press-drag-release (origin → tip), render
  as classic kite glyphs, and the tip is draggable in Setup. Rotating a bone (body
  drag in Animate) spins its subtree around the origin with real leverage.
- [x] **Skinning / mesh deformation** — bind selected art to selected bones (one
  button, auto inverse-square-distance weights to bone segments; `src/skin.ts`
  unit-tested): static transforms bake into rest geometry, the part's motion then
  comes purely from bone deltas via per-frame linear-blend deformation. Unbind in the
  inspector. Skinned parts are marked ≋ in Layers. Limitation (documented): exports
  render skinned parts rigidly — LBS is not representable in Compose/Lottie
  transform replay.
- [x] **Graph/curve editor** — "curves" toggle in the timeline opens a value-vs-time
  plot of the selected key's track: draggable key dots (retime/re-value), per-segment
  bezier handles (dimmed = preset easing; grab to convert to a custom
  `cubic-bezier`), reset-to-preset. Custom beziers sample exactly in the app and
  export as `CubicBezierEasing(...)` (Compose) and native `o`/`i` handles (Lottie).
- [x] **Prettier icons** — inline SVG icon set for the tool switcher, flip, group,
  bone, bind, and align/distribute buttons.

### v2 — second batch (done)

- [x] **Persistent node-type flags** — `sodipodi:nodetypes` imports onto paths
  (`RigPath.nodeTypes`, one char per node: c/s/z), persists through projects, tints
  node handles (green = smooth, red = symmetric), and DRIVES handle dragging: 's'
  nodes mirror the opposite handle's direction, 'z' also matches its length, 'c'
  moves freely (untyped nodes fall back to collinearity detection). The
  smooth/symmetric/corner ops set the flag persistently; node insert/delete keep the
  string in sync.
- [x] **Full node multi-select** — Shift+click toggles nodes, dragging on blank
  canvas in node mode rubber-band-selects, dragging any selected node moves the whole
  set (cross-path deltas converted through each path's frame), ops apply to every
  selected node, Delete removes them, arrows nudge (Shift = ×10).
- [x] **Skew handles** — the rotate handle set now has Inkscape's side handles:
  dragging shears the part along that edge with the opposite edge pinned, stored as
  `rest.kx/ky` degrees (innermost with rest scale around the local pivot, tan-additive
  composition). skewX/skewY parse and compose in the transform layer; Compose exports
  a folded `svgMatrix(...)`, Lottie bakes it into geometry; inspector gets skew x/y
  fields.

### v2.5 — editing focus & node UX (done)

- [x] **Double-click drill-down fixed** — drills resolve the artwork under the cursor
  with `elementsFromPoint`, looking through overlay widgets. (Root cause of the
  regression: the first click of a double-click selects the group and draws its pivot
  grab circle exactly where the second click lands; the overlay ate the dblclick.)
  Pivot grab shrunk. Slow second click still swaps scale/rotate handle sets.
- [x] **Focus/fade drill-down mode** — inside an entered group or while node-editing,
  every part outside the context fades to ~20% and stops catching clicks: you can't
  select faded parts, clicks on them fall through (landing on blank exits the focus),
  and node-mode rubber bands sweep right across them.
- [x] **Node-mode canvas ownership** — in node editing, canvas clicks never switch
  parts: near the edited outline they bend; anywhere else they rubber-band. Leave via
  Layers or Escape.
- [x] **Inkscape node shapes** — diamond = corner, square = smooth, circle =
  symmetric (small circle = untyped), same colors as before.
- [x] **Segment bending** — drag anywhere on a segment between two nodes to bend the
  curve through the pointer (minimal-norm control-point solve, exact at the grab
  parameter); straight segments auto-convert to curves, growing handles.

### v2.6 — bug fixes & small improvements (done)

- [x] **Zoom-proof pivot handle** — the pivot crosshair/ring drew its strokes in
  document units while its radius stays screen-constant, so zooming in fattened the
  strokes until the handle collapsed into a featureless blob. Overlay strokes (pivot
  handle, pivot ghosts, bone lines, drag-gizmo lines/arcs) now use
  `vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke`.
- [x] **Pivot drags never move the artwork** — the pivot participates in the part's
  own rotation and in the innermost rest scale/skew anchor, so re-anchoring it used
  to shift the rendered part whenever the part had any rest rotation, scale, or skew.
  The drag now solves the pivot and a rest-translation compensation together, so the
  joint follows the pointer and the artwork stays exactly put. (Setup-only, like all
  pivot editing; keyed tx/ty values are absolute and intentionally unaffected.)
- [x] **Ctrl constrains moves to an axis** — holding Ctrl during any free translate
  drag (Setup body move, Animate Shift+move, the translate gizmo's center square)
  locks the delta to the dominant axis — perfectly horizontal or vertical. The dashed
  drag line and Δ readout show the constrained movement.
- [x] **Arrow-key part nudge** — in Setup pose mode, arrows nudge the selected parts
  by 2 screen pixels (Shift = 20), converted through the current zoom and each part's
  parent chain like a translate drag. Animate keeps arrows for keyframe nudge /
  playhead scrub; node editing keeps its node nudge.

### v2.7 — vector-app parity & polish (done)

- [x] **Segment delete (break path)** — select 2 adjacent nodes: a closed path opens
  at the break (seam rotates, old Z becomes a straight segment); an open path splits
  into two paths (second labeled `·2`, shows in Layers). Pure ops in `paths.ts`,
  `nodeTypes` kept in lockstep, compound paths refused (buttons disable).
- [x] **Join nodes (weld) & join with segment** — select the 2 free ends of open
  path(s): same path closes (weld to midpoint, or straight closing segment);
  different paths merge into one (one side auto-reverses; arcs reverse by sweep-flag
  flip, no cubic conversion).
- [x] **Double-click off the shape escapes node editing** — a dblclick that hits no
  artwork exits the entered path/group context and deselects everything.
- [x] **Snapping, toggleable** (from the v3 list, scoped small) — Setup drags only:
  node↔node (same part), pivot↔nodes/pivots, part-translate pivot↔pivot + bbox
  center/corners/edge-midpoints; 8 screen px threshold; respects Ctrl axis-lock; one
  overlay marker; magnet button + `%` key; persisted preference (default ON). Pure
  math in `snap.ts` (unit-tested).
- [x] **Standard shortcuts** — Ctrl+S save, Ctrl+O open, Ctrl+A select-all
  (context-aware), Ctrl+D duplicate parts (fresh ids, +12/+12, no tracks, skips
  skinned), `+`/`-` zoom at canvas center; F/Space/letter bindings hardened against
  held modifiers (Ctrl+F no longer double-fires with the browser find bar).
- [x] **`?` / F1 shortcut help overlay** — data-driven from `help.ts`'s SHORTCUTS
  registry (46 bindings, 7 groups), Escape/backdrop/✕ to close, `?` toolbar button.
- [x] **Visual polish pass** — CSS design tokens (spacing/control-height/radius/
  border/shadow), hover/active/disabled/focus-visible states everywhere, tabular
  numerals, themed scrollbars, grouped toolbar + brand mark, subtler checkerboard,
  keyframe/playhead affordances, reduced-motion support. No selector renames; canvas
  overlay color language untouched.

### v2.8 — Rive export & format confidence (done)

- [x] **Rive `.riv` exporter** — the whole doc, all clips as named animations, as one
  binary that plays in official Rive runtimes on every platform Rive supports
  (deliberately playback-only: the Rive editor cannot import .riv — Rig Studio IS
  the editor). Schema from rive-runtime `dev/defs`; verified live against
  `@rive-app/canvas` (exact keyed rotations, custom-bezier curve match, static
  unkeyed channels); unit-tested with an in-repo binary decoder.
- [x] **Project format verified lossless** — maximal-doc serialize→deserialize deep
  equality + byte-stable re-serialize + identical sampling, normalizeDoc back-compat
  for pre-feature files, autosave shares the same code path. Editor preferences
  intentionally stay out of the file.

### v2.9 — Rive-style state machines (done)

- [x] **Core model + evaluator** — inputs (bool/number/trigger), entry/any/exit/
  animation states, transitions with AND-ed conditions and crossfade blend
  durations, pointer listeners; pure deterministic evaluator (`stateMachine.ts`)
  with Rive-like trigger consumption and blend retargeting; serialized in
  `.rig.json` with back-compat.
- [x] **Graph editor + live preview** — timeline `🔀 logic` view: draggable state
  graph, transition arrows with condition/blend editors, inputs with live controls,
  listeners; ▶ preview drives the canvas in real time and canvas clicks fire
  listeners.
- [x] **.riv state-machine export** — machines export into the same .riv and are
  driven by name/inputs in official Rive runtimes (verified: bool-driven blend with
  exact midpoint, trigger transitions). Android: `RiveAnimationView` +
  `stateMachineName` + `setBooleanState`/`fireState`.

### v2.10 — generic editor & SM editor polish (done)

- [x] **Compose (.kt) exporter removed** — Rive `.riv` (rive-android) replaces it on
  Android; the editor is now export-target generic (Rive + Lottie).
- [x] **De-Dosey/de-Pip sweep** — no app-specific code, naming, or intentions left;
  README rewritten; the bundled sample is just a neutral demo asset.
- [x] **State-machine graph pan/zoom** — wheel-zoom-at-cursor, middle-drag pan,
  ⌂ fit, per-machine view memory; correct pointer math at any zoom.
- [x] **Exit state always exists** — entry/any/exit minted together, re-established
  on load, undeletable in the editor (matches what Rive runtimes require).

### v2.11 — interaction harness + view.ts split (done)

- [x] **Headless interaction-test harness** — Vitest Browser Mode (headless
  Chromium), `npm run test:interaction`: 19 real-gesture tests pinning the 12
  hard-learned canvas invariants in ~1 s; mutation-checked before being trusted.
- [x] **view.ts modular split** — 3,089-line monolith → permanent 33-line facade +
  13 layered `src/view/` modules with a binding import-layering rule; zero behavior
  change (all gates green after every mechanical step; export surface
  diff-identical; live manual pass at the end).

### v2.12 — UX overhaul program (done 2026-07-11)

Decisions locked with Austin: Setup mode renames to **Edit** (UI/docs only; internal
enum stays `setup`); bones **auto-bind on placement**; AI pose snapshot sends the
**current playhead pose** with clear labeling; the AI structural-edit schema must
work with the reworked bone system.

Implementation phases (P1 first — it moves files — then maximum parallelism):

- [x] **P1. Architecture docs + feature folders** — CLAUDE.md gains a code-
  architecture section (self-documenting code, ~200-line file guideline — a smell
  threshold, not a hard limit; feature-grouped folders). src/ reorganizes into
  feature folders (core model/history, geometry, io/export, view/, timeline/,
  panels split into layers/inspector/ai modules behind a facade like view's, ai,
  ui). `npm run pages` (Austin's new gh-pages script) must keep working.
- [x] **P2a. Dialog system + context menus + inline rename** — in-app modal dialogs
  replace every alert/prompt/confirm (save, exports, animation rename/add);
  double-click a layer renames INLINE (input-in-place); right-click context menus
  on layer rows (rename/duplicate/delete/group/ungroup/z-order/bind) and on canvas
  objects (mode-appropriate ops). "Setup" → "Edit" UI rename lands here.
- [x] **P2b. Node-editing polish + drag bug fixes** — node type glyphs scale with
  zoom (currently vanish when zoomed in); selected nodes get an outline + size
  bump; zero-length bezier handles hidden; segment-bend through a smooth/symmetric
  node preserves the node type (mirrors the opposite handle instead of silently
  degrading to corner); glyph shapes stay Inkscape-parity (diamond corner / square
  smooth / circle symmetric). Fix the gray-triangle visual artifact under the drag
  delta label. Fix rotation keys recording the "wrong direction" (angle wrapping).
- [x] **P2c. Artboard (canvas size)** — optional, toggleable, resizable canvas rect
  on the doc (defaults from the imported SVG viewBox): rendered as a page
  boundary, editable in the inspector, used as the export reference frame.
- [x] **P3. Selection & navigation semantics (Inkscape parity)** — double-click
  DIVES into a group (enters context without selecting); further double-clicks
  dive deeper; single clicks inside the context select individual children
  (bounding box on the active item only); blank-click/Escape steps out. Layers
  panel: Shift+click = range select, Ctrl+click = toggle; canvas Shift/Ctrl+click
  = add to selection. Unified V "gizmo" tool in BOTH modes: first click =
  translate/scale handles (body drag translates), second click = rotate/skew
  handles (body drag ROTATES around the pivot — Edit writes rest, Animate keys);
  gizmo shows a rotate circle + move cross with hover highlighting.
- [x] **P4. Bones 2.0 (the big one)** — femur icon; child bones spawn at the
  parent's tip; placing bones over/inside an art part AUTO-BINDS it (LBS weights)
  so a 3-bone chain bends an arm with zero manual steps; manual refinement mode:
  select path nodes → bind to a bone with an origin↔tip % slider (per-node weight
  overrides); richer inspector (bindings visible/editable per part and per node);
  IK verified end-to-end on a sample multi-bone limb (bend-direction preserving,
  reach-clamped; per-bone rotation limits deferred unless trivially cheap). The
  bone system gets its own design doc section (how weights/bindings work).
- [x] **P5a. Timeline/Animate overhaul** — named panel sections; per-property
  keyframe toggle circles in the inspector; marquee-friendly padding around key
  lanes; alternating lane colors; transport buttons (⏮ ◀ ▶/⏸ ▶| ⏭); curves/logic
  as a mutually exclusive mode picker + onion as a toggle; dialog-based add/rename;
  visual section separation; a resize splitter between canvas and timeline. Curves
  editor: value snapping + "reset to keyframe value", more vertical headroom,
  pan/zoom in the plot.
- [x] **P5b. AI assistant polish** — panel visible only in Animate; editor disabled
  during a request with a Cancel button; snapshot option relabeled with a help
  tooltip stating it sends the CURRENT PLAYHEAD pose; structural-edit schema
  extended to the new bone system (AI can split a limb into bound bones).

### v2.13 — bones-as-hierarchy, freeze mode, table stakes (planned 2026-07-11, in flight)

Decisions locked with Austin: a chain deforms ONLY the object it's parented under
(hierarchy IS the assignment — no hidden bindings; multi-object cases group first);
the ≋ "skinned" badge becomes a subtle renamed indicator (bone glyph + "deformed by
its bones" tooltip); bezier-handle-level manual weights are deferred (control points
inherit from their neighboring vertex).

- [x] **Bones/skinning bug overhaul** (done d1c26b5): reproduce-then-fix the six
  live-use bugs — bbox auto-bind grabbing the wrong parts (→ real point-in-fill
  targeting + selected-part preference), bind not render-neutral, stale overlay
  after placement, dead-end clicks on deformed parts, independently draggable
  child origins (→ shared joints), inert IK tool.
- [x] **Freeze mode (Rive parity)** (done b7ae446): `Y` key + toolbar toggle with an UNMISSABLE
  in-freeze indicator (banner + canvas tint). Pivots/origins/joints are visible
  but immovable (and don't change the cursor) outside freeze; freeze unlocks
  exactly that editing. Prevents the constant accidental origin-drags.
- [x] **Bone position model** (done b7ae446): only a chain's ROOT bone has a position; child
  bones are rotation + length from the parent tip (inspector shows exactly
  that; tips/origins derive). Editing length/rotation is how you fit a chain to
  artwork.
- [x] **Assignment via hierarchy** (done d1c26b5/b7ae446): placing a chain under an object is the whole
  assignment story; weights stay auto-derived data (per-vertex, manual override
  editor remains for refinement); the layers indicator gets the subtle rename.
- [x] **File → New** (done b7ae446): a New button (in-app confirm when unsaved work
  exists) starting a fresh blank document with a default artboard.
- [x] **Table-stakes gap audit** (done 2026-07-11) — findings filed below.

#### Table-stakes gap audit findings (2026-07-11)

Category A — done (a66884c):
- [x] **Unsaved-changes guard** — dirty flag at the checkpoint() chokepoint; New/
  Open/Load sample confirm only when dirty; beforeunload warns when dirty.
- [x] **Still-image export (PNG, SVG)** — toolbar buttons, @1x/@2x, artboard or
  selection crop, chrome stripped, transparent background.

Follow-ups from live bones testing (queued behind the freeze-semantics wave):
- [x] **MAJOR: node editing on a bone-deformed part is incoherent** (f89d6dc) — node handles
  sit on the REST shape while the art draws deformed; dragging momentarily aligns
  them, release diverges again. Fix: entering node editing on a bound part renders
  THAT PART at rest (bind pose) for the duration — node editing edits rest data,
  so the visuals must show rest; deformation resumes on exit (+ a hint).
- [x] **Bones visible in node-editing mode** (f89d6dc) (currently dimmed/hidden with the
  other parts — they're the binding context and must stay visible/selectable).
- [x] **Bind button moves off the top bar** (f89d6dc) → node-editing-only, appears when
  node(s) are selected; if no bone tip/origin is co-selected, opens a dialog
  (which child bone of this part + tip-or-origin) — replaces the old whole-part
  bind (auto-bind covers that path now).
- [x] **Canvas-tools bar overflow** (f89d6dc) — long hint text (e.g. the IK tool's) pushes
  buttons out of view. Buttons must never hide: hint moves to its own slim second
  line (ellipsis + full text on hover).
- [x] **Bone glyphs not zoom-stable** (f89d6dc) (kite geometry in doc units) — fix per the
  new CLAUDE.md screen-constant-chrome gotcha, plus a generic zoom-sweep harness
  assertion so the whole class of bug gets caught.
- [x] **IK drag feedback** (f89d6dc) — highlight the solving chain + target line during an
  IK drag so the tool explains itself.
- [x] **Nested-group SVG import** (f89d6dc) — the importer flattens below the top level;
  rework to recursive: EVERY group becomes a part at any depth (exact SVG
  structure preserved — user decision; label = inkscape:label, else the SVG id,
  rename in-editor), parented per the nesting, geometry stays doc-space per the
  app convention. Acceptance fixture: public/girl_example.svg.
- [x] **Tip drags never change a child bone's length** (f89d6dc) — dragging a parent's tip
  moves the shared joint; every descendant's local geometry (length + relative
  direction) is invariant, riding the joint. (Reported with screenshots; child
  currently shortens.)
- [x] **Group handle sets** (next commit) — groups currently draw only the passive dashed union
  box: no scale/rotate corners, and the second-click mode toggle is invisible.
  Fix: first click = scale handles implemented as DISTRIBUTED rest edits (scale
  every descendant's rest size+position about the group pivot, one undo — the
  flipSelected pattern); second click = rotate handles (group rest.rotate,
  which genuinely propagates); skew skipped for groups (the set still visibly
  changes). Backed by the new visible-counterpart GOTCHA in CLAUDE.md.
- [x] **Full-chain IK (FABRIK)** (05f0803) — the current analytic solver rotates exactly two
  ancestor joints and never the grabbed bone itself (it and its parent move as one
  rigid unit; depth capped). Replace with an n-joint FABRIK solve from the grabbed
  tip to the chain root: every joint participates incl. the grabbed bone's own
  rotation, lengths preserved, current-pose bias (no flips), deterministic
  iterations; Edit writes rests, Animate keys; chain highlight covers all
  participating bones.
- [x] **Keyframeable z-order** (editor bf05493; .riv DrawRules export 7155013;
  panel/paint-order unification dbac402) — paint order stays flat/hierarchy-independent (by
  design); add a keyable `z` offset channel per part (STEPPED sampling — no easing
  between stacking ranks), rendering sorts by (z, rest index); inspector shows
  stacking position + up/down in Edit and the keyable offset in Animate; AI schema
  learns the channel (the reach-behind-grab-pill use case). Phase 2 (blocked on
  the user's uncommitted exportRiv.ts WIP): .riv export via Rive DrawTarget/
  DrawRules keyed draw order; Lottie cannot animate layer order — documented
  limitation.
- [x] **Opacity channel + layers eye (revised per Rive-parity principle)**
  (editor e8c1f8a; .riv keyed opacity 7155013) —
  `opacity` becomes a keyable continuous channel (rest opacity in Edit, keyed in
  Animate; Rive-native, Lottie `o`). The layers EYE is editor-only and NEVER
  keyable (user decision — no visibility channel; animated invisibility = opacity
  0): `part.hidden` serializes, hidden parts don't render and are excluded from
  exports. New convention in CLAUDE.md: keyable channels must map to Rive runtime
  features.
- [x] **Export wave** (7155013): .riv keyed z draw order via DrawTarget/DrawRules;
  .riv opacity keys (Lottie frozen per the user's ruling); FULL hidden-subtree
  exclusion in .riv; verified against the official @rive-app/canvas runtime
  (on-screen visuals remain on Austin's review list).

*Contradiction resolved by the orchestrator 2026-07-13: these three were shipped
and verified during the autonomous run but their checkboxes were never ticked —
ticked above with their commit trail.*

## v3 — Future

- Per-bone length/stiffness constraints; pole targets for IK.
- Skin weight painting (manual override of the automatic weights).
- Path boolean ops (union/subtract/intersect), stroke→path outline conversion.
- Mirror-flip by dragging a scale handle through zero.
- 'auto' node type (Inkscape's 'a': continuous re-smoothing as neighbors move).
- Marquee part-selection in pose mode (rubber-band over parts, not just nodes/keys).
- Layers quality-of-life: visibility (eye) and lock toggles, per-part opacity,
  multi-row drag, rename-in-place instead of prompt().
- Copy/paste parts (with artwork) and paste-across-documents (duplicate shipped in
  v2.7 as Ctrl+D).
- Canvas chrome: rulers, guides, zoom percentage indicator + zoom-to-selection
  (simple snapping shipped in v2.7; alignment guide lines while dragging remain).
- Playback range (work area) markers on the timeline; loop a sub-range.
- Keyframe-all-channels button ("key pose") and auto-key toggle.
- Import: gradients, clip-paths, text-to-path fallback; better error surfacing for
  unsupported SVG features.
- Text, gradients, clipping/masks in imports and exports.
- Per-part motion-suggestion AI mode; conversational multi-turn choreography editing.
- Skinning export parity (baked-frame export or a runtime player).
